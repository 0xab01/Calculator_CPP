# My First C++ Program

This is a simple calculator program written in C++. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Here are the steps to compile and run the program:

1. Save the code in a file named `calculator.cpp`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, if you have `g++` installed, run the following command:


4. Run the compiled executable by executing the following command:


5. The program will prompt you to enter the first number, the operation, and the second number. Follow the instructions and input the values accordingly.
6. After entering the required inputs, the program will calculate and display the result.

## Contributing

As this is your first C++ program, you might want to enhance it or explore other programming concepts. You can add more functionalities, improve error handling, or create a graphical user interface (GUI) version using a library like Qt. Feel free to experiment and learn!
